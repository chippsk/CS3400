3 Observations
	The first observation on newegg was that the sepcs were easy to find.  Being able to quickly find what you are looking for is nice.  Neweggs prices were concrete and there were more options on the other site involving prices.

	The reviews are better on neweggg.  It is better to read reviews about a product that you can tell aren't created by someone being paid by the company.  For some of the older/more popular products have hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews.
	
	It was harder to navigate speicifactions on sites other than newegg. The other websites didn't list all the specifications explicitly, or entirely.  Specifially amazon was virtually impossible to find the specs that aren't the most common when looking at pc parts.
