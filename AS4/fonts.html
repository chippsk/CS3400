		<span class="subtitle">Size</span>
		<p class="contentParagraph">The size of the font on a website can have a huge impact in the user experience.  Users with visual impairments will stuggle with small text, or text that is too close together.  Users with perfect vision will also struggle after a while of looking at hard to read text.  
		<br>
			Look at the following examples.
		<br>
		The following image is an example of font size being too small for the page.  
		
		<img src="img/badfontex.png" width=80%>

		<br>
			Where this example is much easier to read.
		<br>
		<img src="img/goodfontex.png" width=80%>

		<br>
		<br>
		As a general rule of thumb, between 50-75 characters per line at size 16 font will be sufficeint for most purposes.  When talking about desktop users.  
		<br><br>
		For mobile users smaller text becomes even more of an issue.  Here are the same pages side by side as an extreme example of a website that prepares for mobile users and one that does not.
		<br>
		<img src="img/mobilecomp.png" width=80%>

		<p class="contentParagraph">
			Choosing a font type can be an art.  There is no shortage of types of fonts to use, so lets outline what to think about when choosing font types.
			<br>
			Establish a goal
			<br>
			The type of fonts a website uses will be one of the first things a user will notice when browsing to a site.  Things to think about are what the site will be used for.  There are fonts for everything.  Sites that have extensive reading, like large articles, need to use fonts that are easy to read and very legible.  However sites that are meant for entertainment, such as advertising, fonts that are more decorative can be used.  
			<br>
			Legibility and readibility
			<br>
			Legible and readible fonts generally have characteristics such as, convential letterforms (no artsy stuff) and proper spacing between characters.
			<br>
			Limit the amount of typefaces per site.  Generalize around a theme.  Putting too many typefaces in a site will make it chaotic.

		<span class="subtitle">Browser Compatibility</span>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			A more technical side to fonts is the issue of cross browser compatibility.  W3C has a list of "Web Safe Fonts" that ensure compatibility with browsers and operating systems.
