		<span class="subtitle">The bad</span>
		<p>The following is a group of bad examples of website design. Sources include google searches, and websitesthatsuck.com</p>

		<a href="http://cavs.mit.edu/">MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies</a>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			This site seems to be a proof of concept.  It illustrates very well, what not to do.  Jumbled everything, things overlap, no color.  This site seems to be masterfully crafted to be wrong.
			Violates rules: Strive for consistency, informative feedback, permit easy reversal of actions, and most of all reduce short term memory load.

		<a href="http://www.reforms.net/">Reforms</a>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			I don't know what reforms.net does, but I know it's ever growing.  If you manage to wait long enough for it to load.  The homepage is just a little slideshow that takes like 20 seconds to reload.  What little text there is, is too small to read even on a desktop machine.  The animation, which is the entire site isn't very responsive and takes a while to load.

		<a href="http://www.bolenreport.com/">Bolen Report</a>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			This page looks like a committee agreed on its design in the 1990's and they rolled with it ever since.  The content appears to be up to date, but the organization, layout lack of colors, Times New Roman font size 12 is a bit too much.  The home page has everything that has ever been uploaded to the website.  And about halfway down, the website gets about 80% thinner in width.

		<span class="subtitle">The good</span>
		<p> These are some good examples of website design</p>
		<a href="http://dp.la/">The Digital Public Library of America"</a>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			This site has a nice array of colors and the theme is very educational.  Despite being a resource for texts and books, there are complimentary images that spice up the content of the page.  This keeps users attention, as this site it meant to be used for extensive periods of time.
			Follows Rules: Strive for consistency. 
			Violates Rules: Support internal focus of control, Design dialog to yield closure.

		<a href="http://www.isobar.com/ca/home">The Absolut Project</a>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			There is some weird art thing involvoing Aboslut Vodka and some Canandians.  Whatever they do with it doesn't really relate to how nice the website looks.  It's easy to navigate, and since it is more of a casual browser/entertianment type site the pictures and neat scrolling effects keep the user busy and on the site.

		<a href="http://www.nerisson.fr/">This guys freelance advertisement</a>
		<p class="contentParagraph">
			This site is the business card of a freelance web developer.  Obviously his intention is to amaze prospective customers with cool features and lots of proof that he doesn't suck.  The website is simple and laid out so that you get to what you want easiliy.  It is never hard to figure out how to contact him, which is by design, and very smart.
